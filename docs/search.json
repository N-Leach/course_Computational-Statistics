An outcome is the result of such an experiment, and the collection of all possible outcomes is called the sample space \\(S\\). For example:\nRepetitions of a random experiment is known as a trial. If a coin is tossed twice \\(S = \\{(H, H), (T, H), (H, T), (T, T)\\}\\).\nAn event is a subset of the sample space.\nThe numerical results of an a random experiment are random variables(RV). For the example of a coin tossed twice, numeral values can be assigned to each outcome: \\((H, H) = 0, (T, H) = 1, ...\\)\nThe set of possible values for random variable \\(X\\) is denoted by \\(Range(X)\\), \\(R_X\\), \\(\\Omega\\).",
