## Random Variables

A random experiment is a procedure where uncertain events are observed. An **outcome** is the result of such an experiment, and the collection of all possible outcomes is called the **sample space** $\Omega$. For example:

-   a coin toss: $\Omega = \{heads,tails\}$

-   roll a 6 sided die: $\Omega = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$

-   number of rainy days in June: $\Omega = \{0, 1, ..., 30\}$

Repetitions of a random experiment is known as a **trial.** If a coin is tossed twice $\Omega = \{(H, H), (T, H), (H, T), (T, T)\}$.

An **event** is a subset of the sample space.

The numerical results of an a random experiment are **random variables**.

## Discrete random variables

A random variable X is called discrete if:

1.  $\Omega$ is a finite set. Meaning: ...

2.  a countably infinite set (e.g., N)

If $\Omega$ isn't a countable set, X is continuous

### Examples

#### Uniform Distribution

#### Bernoulli Distribution

#### Binomial distribution

``` {webr-r}
n = 5; p = 0.5
omega = 0:n
pmf = dbinom(x = omega, size = n, prob = p)
bin.distr = data.frame(x = omega, pmf)
bin.distr
```

#### **Poisson Distribution**

#### Geometric Distribution

#### Negative Binomial (Pascal) Distribution

#### Hypergeometric Distribution
